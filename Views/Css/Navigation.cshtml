<h2>
    Primary Vs Secondary
</h2>

<p>
    Navigation links guide the user around a website. There is 
    the <b>primary</b> navigation and there is the <b>secondary</b>
    navigation. The primary is used for the main links of 
    a website such the homepage main link and the navigation bar (navbar). 
</p>

<p>
    Secondary navigation is more specific. For example: 
    <div>
        <span class="bg-dark text-white p-2 rounded">Shopping</span>
        →
        <span class="bg-dark text-white p-2 rounded">Computers</span>
        →
        <span class="bg-dark text-white p-2 rounded">GPU</span>
        →
        <span class="bg-dark text-white p-2 rounded">GTX</span>
        →
        <span class="bg-warning p-2 rounded">30 Series</span>
    </div>
</p>
<p>
    The example above is known as a breadcrumb. 
</p>
<p>
    The user can look at a breadcrumb and instantly know where they are. It 
    is useful to provide these breadcrumbs for navigation, but also 
    so that the user can go back and fourth and view other parts of the website, 
    possibly making another sale. 
</p>

<h2>
    Spanning Multiple Pages
</h2>
<p>
    Most navigations span more than one page so that 
    the website is connected through a web of <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tags. 
    Breadcrumbs are much more useful being on every page versus 
    being on one. When the user clicks a link, that page needs 
    to link back to the page where they clicked the link. 
</p>

<p>
    Without using a system or website builder, one has to update the 
    breadcrumb on each page each time a change is made. This is time consuming 
    and it is better to use a system like <code>ASP.NET</code> that always for 
    one partial view to be shared with the rest of the views (pages).
