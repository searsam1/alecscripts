<h2>
    What is Polymorphism?
</h2>
<p>
    With OOP, Polymorphism is the ability for classes to inherit for one another 
    but for those classes to be able to have their own flavor. If ice cream came in one 
    flavor, it wouldn't be as good or popular. All ice cream is served cold and in the same 
    form, but it has different flavors for different tastes. 
</p>
<pre><code class="lang-java">class IceCream {
    public void flavor() {
      System.out.println("Vanilla");
    }
    private static int temperature;

    public static void setTemp(int temp){
        temperature = temp;
    }
    public static int getTemp(){
        return temperature;
    }
  }
  
  class Chocolate extends IceCream {
    public void flavor() {
      System.out.println("Rich Dark Chocolate ");
    }
  }
  
  class Strawberry extends IceCream {
    public void flavor() {
      System.out.println("Creamy Sweet Strawberry");
    }
  }

  class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      
      IceCream.setTemp(20);
      IceCream iceCreamVanilla = new IceCream();  
      IceCream chocolateIceCream = new Chocolate();
      IceCream StrawberryIceCream = new Strawberry();
      iceCreamVanilla.flavor();
      System.out.println(IceCream.getTemp() + "â„‰");
    //   Vanilla

      chocolateIceCream.flavor();
    //   Rich Dark Chocolate 

      StrawberryIceCream.flavor();
    //   Creamy Sweet Strawberry
    }
  }</code></pre>

<p>
    The temperature will stay the same 
    for all flavors, but the objects 
    have unique flavors to them. They share, 
    the flavor attribute, but have unique versions of it.
